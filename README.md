#### Instructions:

- The API returns the dish categories and the dishes in that category.
- The dish categories should be slidable.
- If a dish has addons(`addoncat`), then it should display the text **“Customizations available”**.
- Clicking on the `+` and `-` buttons should update the count accordingly and also on the cart icon on the top bar.
- Implement maintainable and reusable coding standards.
- The tabs must not be hardcoded, their length should change as per API.
